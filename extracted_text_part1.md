## 4.1 The purpose or need of debt
Debt is used to finance goals when personal funds are insufficient (e.g., house, auto, consumer durables, personal loans, credit cards). It comes with a cost (interest) and a repayment obligation. Debt isn't always negative; it can be beneficial for acquiring appreciating assets (like a house) or for education, potentially increasing returns (leverage, Modigliani-Miller Theorem). It can also serve temporary needs during emergencies or cash flow mismatches, allowing individuals to maintain their life path and benefit from compounding investments.

## 4.2 Role and impact of debt in cash flow management
The "goodness" of debt depends on a household's financial situation.

### Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
*   **Definition:** Measures an individual's ability to meet debt obligations with available income.
*   **Lender Perspective:** A lower DTI is generally preferred by lenders for loan approval.
*   **Impact:** A high DTI (e.g., 50%) severely limits the ability to meet other expenses, save for emergencies, or invest for the future.
*   **Factors:** Higher interest rates and larger loan amounts increase monthly repayments, emphasizing the need to align debt with cash flow to avoid disruptions.

### 4.2.1 Differentiating between consumption expenditure and investment expenditure
*   **Advisor's Role:** Influence clients to be prudent in spending by highlighting the impact on financial goals.
*   **Consumption Expenditure:** Does not create an asset or generate future income (e.g., restaurant meals, clothes, salon expenses).
*   **Investment Expenditure:** Leads to asset creation that can generate future income (e.g., buying bonds, property, education for children).
*   **Prioritization:** Investment expenditure should be prioritized.
*   **Budgeting:** Clearly demarcate mandatory payments (taxes, provident fund, loan commitments), essential living expenses (food, shelter), and discretionary expenses (lifestyle).
*   **Savings First:** Adopt the approach of "Income minus Savings = Expenses" rather than "Income minus Expenses = Savings" to ensure future needs are met. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) can facilitate this.

### 4.2.2 Identifying the holes in the household budget
*   **Common Errors:** Unclear classification of essential/discretionary expenses, over-allocation, not "paying self," lack of expense tracking, going over budget.
*   **Advisor's Recommendation:** Encourage tracking all expenses above a set limit (e.g., Rs. 500 or Rs. 5,000, depending on income).
*   **Awareness:** Monthly expense summaries can reveal significant avoidable spending (e.g., eating out, entertainment, constant gadget upgrades), prompting prudence.

### 4.2.3 Allocation to various categories of expenses
*   **Categorization:** Outflows can be categorized into mandatory contributions (PF, retirement), loan servicing, essential expenses, and lifestyle expenses.
*   **Control:** While essential expenses are hard to reduce, lifestyle expenses offer significant scope for control.
*   **Zero-Base Budgeting:** Apply the corporate concept of re-evaluating every expense from scratch, rather than just modifying previous budgets, to ensure intentional spending.

### 4.2.4 Windfalls
*   **Definition:** Unexpected income like high bonuses, inheritance, or lottery winnings.
*   **Action:** A significant portion should be allocated for future needs, pre-paying outstanding loans, or investing.
*   **Temporary Holding:** Can be held in risk-free liquid assets until an appropriate investment decision is made.
*   **Caution:** Do not rely on windfalls to save bad financial situations, as this can lead to poor financial behavior and increased debt.

## 4.3 Leverage and Debt Counselling
Investment Advisers must consider various client-specific factors when advising on debt.

### 4.3.1 Purpose of the debt
*   **Recommended:** For acquiring appreciating assets (real estate) or expenses that increase earning capacity (education loans).
*   **Avoid:** Financing risky investments (margin financing for stocks, which magnifies losses) or regular expenses (leading to a debt trap).
*   **Short-term Liquidity:** Acceptable for temporary liquidity issues if risks are understood and a repayment plan exists.

### 4.3.2 Cost of debt
*   **Impact:** Higher interest rates mean higher debt servicing costs.
*   **Cheaper Loans:** Secured loans (mortgages, education loans) due to lender security.
*   **Expensive Loans:** Unsecured loans (personal loans, credit card debt, unorganized sector loans).
*   **Credit Cards:** Interest-free only if paid in full by the due date. "Revolving credit" (carrying over balances) is extremely expensive (e.g., 3% p.m. compounded annually is 42.6%).

### 4.3.3 Maturity of debt
*   **Shorter Tenor:** Higher periodic repayments, increasing pressure on income.
*   **Longer Tenor:** Lower periodic repayments, but higher total interest paid over the loan term.
*   **Decision:** Loan tenor should be chosen based on the borrower's repayment capacity and DTI.

### 4.3.4 Debt Re-scheduling
If a borrower faces difficulty managing repayments, early action is crucial.
*   **Rank by Cost:** Prioritize and eliminate the costliest debts first (e.g., credit card dues, personal loans).
*   **Sell Asset:** If the debt financed an asset, selling the asset to pre-pay the debt might be an option (consider pre-payment charges).
*   **Refinance:** Avail a lower-cost loan to repay a costlier one (e.g., credit card balance transfer).
*   **Extend Tenor:** Lengthening the loan period reduces monthly outgo but increases total interest paid.
*   **Inform Lender:** Communicate problems to the lender to explore revised schedules, but be aware this can negatively impact your credit history/score.

## 4.4 Calculate the debt servicing requirements

### 4.4.1 Role of Credit Bureaus and Credit Score
*   **Credit Score:** A numerical representation (e.g., CIBIL TransUnion Score 300-900) assigned by credit information bureaus (licensed by RBI) based on an individual's credit behavior and repayment history.
*   **Credit Report:** Detailed information on outstanding loans, credit facilities, repayment behavior, credit utilization, types of loans (proportion of secured/unsecured), and other factors affecting loan servicing ability.
*   **Lender Use:** Banks, HFCs, NBFCs use the score and report to determine loan eligibility, interest rates, and credit limits. A higher score generally leads to better terms.
*   **Building a Good Score:**
    *   Pay all dues (loans, credit cards) on time.
    *   Maintain low credit utilization relative to available credit.
    *   Have a mix of secured and unsecured credit.
    *   Apply for credit only when needed and in moderation.
    *   Repayment behavior as a joint holder or guarantor also affects the score.
    *   Periodically review your credit report for errors.
*   **Accessing Your Credit Score:**
    *   Directly from licensed credit bureaus (e.g., CIBIL, EXPERIAN, CRIF Highmark, Equifax) online using personal details.
    *   Through loan providers with legitimate tie-ups (ensure authenticity to avoid scams).
*   **RBI's Regulation about Free Credit Score:**
    *   Every individual is entitled to one free full credit report annually from each credit bureau.
    *   The report should be identical to what financial institutions access.
    *   It must enable borrowers to rectify errors (wrong info, loan closure status).
    *   Includes the credit score and repayment history for the last 2-3 years.
    *   Valid for a calendar year (Jan-Dec).
    *   Accessible in electronic format after authentication (UID, PAN).
    *   Credit scoring reports are also available for non-individuals (companies).

## 4.5 Responsible Borrowing
Responsible borrowing is essential for managing financial health.
*   **Key Principle:** Never borrow more than you can comfortably afford to repay. Avoid unsustainable, flashy lifestyles.
*   **Credit Cards:** Always pay off the full outstanding amount by the due date to avoid expensive "revolving credit."
*   **Loan Purpose:** Prioritize borrowing for value-appreciating assets that can generate future income.
*   **Loan Quantity:** Avoid taking on too many loans simultaneously, as this can make debt servicing unmanageable.
*   **Sustainability:** Responsible use of debt facilities ensures long-term financial stability.
