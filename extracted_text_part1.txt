Even though income might be higher than expenses it is not possible to finance every purchase or asset with just the existing savings. For example, most people cannot buy a house without a loan. This is because the cost of a house is huge and if people waited till they had enough savings to buy a house then it is likely that this would not be possible till they near retirement. Lenders protect themselves by securing their loan against a charge or security or pledge or mortgage on the property. Such loans are also called ‘mortgages’. Other debt includes auto loans, credit taken for buying consumer durables, personal loans and credit card outstanding. However, debt comes at a cost and imposes a repayment obligation on the borrower. The decision on whether or not to use debt will depend upon the ability of the available income to bear the additional charge of interest cost and repayment. Debt is not always bad, it has to be seen in perspective as to what is it being spent for. As an example, debt for acquisition of house property is not bad. In some cases, the decision to use borrowed funds over own funds, also called leverage, may actually increase the return made 65 on an investment (Modigliani-Miller Theorem (M&M)). In some cases, a loan may make more sense in a given situation. For example, an education loan may be a better choice than drawing from a retirement account to fund the children’s education. The future income would be easily able to repay the loan and at the same time the existing funds can continue to earn without losing the benefit of compounding. Continuation of existing investments is important, to maintain the compounding effect. It can be seen that debt is needed under various circumstances and sometimes it can be also for temporary use of funds. This kind of short-term needs might arise due to some emergency or some cash flow mismatch but it can ensure that an individual is able to continue on their life path without facing sudden disruptions. 4.2 Role and impact of debt in cash flow management While some debt is good and may even be recommended, how much debt is good depends upon the financial situation of each household. A good indicator is the debt-to-income ratio (DTI) that measures the ability to meet the obligations arising from debt with the available income. There is no "perfect or optimal" DTI ratio that lenders require, but all lenders tend to agree that a lower DTI is better. Depending on the size and type of loan they're issuing, lenders set their own limits on how low your DTI must be for loan approval. Consider a salaried employee who draws a salary of Rs. 15,000 per month, and is paying Rs7,500 towards debt servicing. The debt servicing ratio comes to Rs.7,500 ÷ Rs15,000 i.e. 50%. This is too high. If 50% goes towards debt servicing, it affects the ability to meet other regular expenses, provide for emergencies and the person may have nothing left to invest for the future. The interest rate and the amount of debt play an important role as far as the measurement of the impact of the debt is concerned. A higher interest rate will raise the repayment amount that will have to be paid and similarly a higher loan amount will also increase the monthly repayment amount. One has to look at the cash flow and then decide on the amount of debt that will be taken. All this needs to be done to ensure that the debt and its outflow do not disrupt the entire cash flow management plan laid out. Often there could be a situation wherein the debt servicing needs are high and at the same time a crisis on some other front can leave little room for borrowing some more amounts to tide over it. This is also the reason why the debt servicing amount needs to be low so that there is scope for raising some more funds in case this is required. 66 4.2.1 Differentiating between consumption expenditure and investment expenditure Many clients have an endless list of lifestyle expenses. The Investment Adviser should be able to influence the client to be prudent in the expenditure. This can be done by highlighting how expenditure might affect the chances of the family being able to fulfil some other financial goal. One way to differentiate the various expenditures is by classifying them as consumption expenditure and investment expenditure. Consumption expenditure is that amount which once used does not create any asset that generates further income. Amount spent at a restaurant or for buying clothes or expenses made at a saloon are some examples of consumption expenditure. On the other hand investment expenditure will lead to the creation of an asset, which then can generate further income in the future. The trade-offs should be clearly understood by the client. For example, buying a bond or a property can be investment expenditure. Some outflows, like providing education to children, may appear to be consumption expenditure. But they may be a useful investment, if the children do well and are able to raise the family’s income. Such expenditure needs to be prioritized. A budget that clearly demarcates mandatory and legal payments such as taxes, contributions to provident fund and gratuity and loan commitments, essential living expenses such as food and shelter and discretionary expenses such as lifestyle expenses, will help allocate income better between current and future needs. Allocate savings for goals before considering the discretionary expenses. This will make sure that the future needs are taken care of. Systematic investment plan (SIPs), especially when automatically transferred from the salary, helps in prioritizing the investment expenditure. The approach of people should be, instead of Income minus Expenses = Savings i.e. save only after expenses, to make it Income minus Savings = Expenses i.e. spend after savings. 4.2.2 Identifying the holes in the household budget A household may not be managing its income and expenses efficiently to enable savings for goals. Some common errors that make it seem as if savings are not possible include not being clear if an expense is an essential living expense or discretionary in nature, incorrect (higher) allocation for expenses, not ‘paying self’ before allocating for discretionary expenses, not tracking expenses regularly and hence going over-budget, among others. Very often, clients do not realise how much money goes in various avoidable expenses. The adviser should inculcate the habit in the client, to note down all expenses above a specific level. The limit may be Rs.500 for some clients; Rs.5,000 for some others. The actual figure would depend on the income level of the client. A summarisation of the list of expenses at the end of the month can be enlightening, even for the client. For example, the amount that went in eating out or entertainment might be pretty 67 high but this might not register for the client because all payments were made by credit card so this was not actually tracked. When the client recognises the scale of the lost opportunity to save, there is better likelihood of prudence in future. An adviser’s primary role is to identify and eliminate these lacunae that inhibit savings. There are often cases where a lot of money is spent on buying the latest gadgets when this is not necessary. Spending on a gadget like a phone or a laptop is necessary because it helps in work and increases efficiency and learning for an individual or the household. However constant upgradation just so that they have the latest model to show off is not a wise way to spend money and the amount saved from such expenses can be used at several other places. 4.2.3 Allocation to various categories of expenses The monthly summary of outflows helps in understanding the current prioritization. If unusual expenses are kept out (for instance, a hospitalization that was not covered by insurance), the balance outflows can be categorized as mandatory contributions to provident fund and other retirement savings, loan servicing, essential expenses and lifestyle expenses. Families vary in their financial circumstances. The advisor should work with the family in setting limits on various categories of outflows. The household can make additional savings possible by changing their choices on the expenses they incur. An essential expense does not lend itself to much reduction but lifestyle expenses can be controlled to a large extent. Considering the alternate use to which the income can be used instead of spending it on discretionary expenses is one way in which such expenses can be controlled. In corporate finance, there is a concept of ‘zero base budgeting’ which means, rather than taking the previous budget as the reference point and modifying the numbers, take it from scratch. In that case, each and every expense is thought through, and is not incurred just because it was incurred earlier. The concept can be applied in household finances as well. 4.2.4 Windfalls Clients occasionally earn a windfall such as unexpectedly high annual bonus, inheritance, winning a lottery, etc.. A healthy portion of such unexpected income should be set apart for the future, since the family is used to living without that windfall. This can also be the time to take a look at the outstanding loans and consider pre-paying some of them. Windfall gain need not be invested immediately, and can be deployed as and when appropriate. The gain may be held in risk free liquid assets, till investment decision is reached. The amount of the windfall should be properly allocated as the extent of the windfall matters. For example, a very high annual bonus a year can be used to prepay loans and at the same time make some additional investments too, which can yield a return in the future. One should not expect a windfall to occur regularly in the hope that this will save a bad financial 68 situation, as this can encourage wayward financial behaviour and still end up with a higher amount of debt when the windfall does not materialise. 4.3 Leverage and Debt Counselling Investment Advisers need to consider various aspects when they are advising clients on debt as this can have a big role in the kind of financial behaviour that is witnessed. Many factors will vary for a client and each of these needs to be taken into consideration when a specific plan is put forward. Some of the factor here includes the following: 4.3.1 Purpose of the debt Debt or loan should ideally be taken for acquiring appreciating assets such as real estate. Some debt may be recommended to meet an expense that will increase the value of an asset, say an education loan to upskill, so that the income generating ability of the person goes up. Financing risky or volatile investment propositions with debt may entail high risk and may put the entire financial security of the individual or household at risk. Margin financing for stock market investing is one such investment. A fall in the value of the investment will magnify the loss since the cost of debt will also have to be accounted for. Debt should certainly not be used for financing one’s regular expenses. If a person starts borrowing to meet expenses, then he is clearly living beyond his means and likely to be in a debt trap. Taking short term debt to tide over temporary liquidity problems may be fine, as long as the borrower knows the risk and has a plan to repay the debt as soon as possible. 4.3.2 Cost of debt Higher the rate of interest at which money is borrowed, more will be the outgo in servicing the debt. Secured loans, such as mortgages, and education loans are relatively cheaper as there is the benefit of the security available to the lender. Unsecured loans such as personal loans and credit card debt are very expensive and must be used with caution. Credit card is an interest free borrowing option only if the use is within the limits specified, and the repayments are made by the due date each month. When the credit card user does not pay the entire amount i.e. some amount is carried over for payment in the following business cycles, it is called “revolving credit”. If a credit card company charges 3% p.m. as interest, the compounded annual cost is (1+3%)^12-1 i.e. 42.6%. Given the exorbitant cost, revolving credit should be avoided. A similar argument can be made for loans for unorganized sector like pawn traders or money lenders who charge as high as 60-80% interest rate or 5% a month from people. 4.3.3 Maturity of debt Shorter the tenor of the loan; more will be the periodic repayment putting pressure on available income. Even if the cost of debt is low, short loan tenor can put financial pressures 69 in repayment. Therefore, loan tenor should be decided keeping in mind the repayment capacity of the borrower. A longer tenor loan translates into higher interest paid over the term. The debt-to-income ratio can be used as an indicator of what the household income can take on as repayment obligations, and decide on the tenor accordingly. 4.3.4 Debt Re-scheduling If the borrower is unable to manage the debt repayments, then it helps to work out a solution as soon as possible. Potential solutions are as follows: * Rank debt in order of their cost and deal with the costliest debt first. Typically, credit card dues and personal loans will be the most expensive, and work to eliminate them from the outstanding debt list. Low-cost debt and debt that provide tax benefits such as home loans and education loans can be dealt with later when finances permit. * If the debt was taken for purchasing an asset, then the asset can be sold and the proceeds used for pre-paying the debt provided the asset has a reasonable realisable value. While doing this, the borrower should also plan for any pre-payment charges that the bank may levy. * If the cost of debt is high, then cheaper re-financing is an option. A lower cost loan can be availed to repay the costlier loan. A credit card balance transfer is an example of such refinancing. * If the problem is with the tenor of the loan, then the possibility of extending the tenor of the loan can be explored. This will reduce the monthly outgo in debt servicing. However, the loan will be repaid over a longer period of time and the total interest paid over the tenor of the loan will go up. * If none of these is possible, then the borrower should inform the lender about the problem and explore a revised loan schedule. It should however be noted that such re-scheduling of loans hurts the borrower’s credit history (also known as credit score like CIBIL score). This will affect the chances of obtaining loans in future or the cost at which they will become available. 4.4 Calculate the debt servicing requirements 4.4.1 Role of Credit Bureaus and Credit Score Credit score is a number assigned to each individual by a credit information bureau based on their credit behaviour and repayment history. A credit bureau is licenced by the RBI and governed by the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005. The credit and financial health of the individual is assessed on the basis of the outstanding loans and credit facilities used, repayment behaviour exhibited, utilization of credit limits, type of loans i.e. the proportion of credit card outstanding, personal loans and other unsecured loans, and other factors that may affect the ability to service loans. This information is reported on a 70 monthly basis by providers of loans and credit to the credit information companies. Here it is collated and used to develop the credit score and the credit report. For example, the CIBIL TransUnion Score is a three digit number ranging from 300 to 900. Banks, Housing Finance Companies, NBFCs use this score and report for making decisions on a loan application to determine interest rate, loan eligibility and credit limits. A high credit score makes the lender consider the loan application and the terms of offer. A good credit score and credit report can be built by dealing with debt responsibly. Always pay dues on loans, credit cards and others on time. Credit utilization relative to credit available should be kept low. Too much of unsecured loans such as credit cards or high utilization on your credit card limits and personal loans have a negative impact on the score. For a good score it is important to have a mix of secured and unsecured credit and to apply for credit, or make credit enquiries only when required, and in moderation. A person’s credit score is also affected by the repayment behaviour in loans where they are joint holders or guarantors. Review the credit report periodically so that any errors can be identified and rectified. Accessing your credit score In order to have access to your credit score the client has to go to a credit bureau that is licensed to operate in the country. The various personal details can be mentioned to the bureau and the appropriate credit score and even the credit report can be taken. The credit report will not just have the score but all the details of the various loans outstanding and those that the client has serviced or missed payments on or even settled. The credit bureaus allow for online access to the details for an individual, so this is also an option that can be used to directly access the credit score. The client can open their account with their login details and password on the website of the credit bureau and then check the details. There is also a tie-up by the credit bureaus with various loan providers, so the client can also get their credit score from such loan providers. One has to be careful about accessing the credit score this way because one has to be sure that there is a genuine tie up for access to such scores and that this is not some online scam targeting people for their personal information. RBI’s regulation about free credit score The importance of credit scores is increasing with each passing day and there is a greater emphasis on this aspect while a new loan is sanctioned by various banks and financial institutions. In order to protect the customer and enable them to get the right kind of 71 information, RBI has introduced some specific conditions with respect to free credit scores. Some of the highlights here include: * Every individual is entitled to a free copy of their credit report every year from each credit bureau also known as credit information companies. In India, you can access the same from CIBIL, EXPERIAN, CRIF Highmark and Equifax. * The customer should get a full copy of such a credit report which is the same as what is accessed by the financial institutions when they check the credit details of a borrower. * The report should also enable the borrower to rectify the mistakes like wrong info, loan closure if any, present in the credit report. * The credit report will have the credit score plus the details of the latest outstanding loans that are there for the individual. Typically, the report shows, repayment history for last 2-3 years * The year for this purpose is from January to December or a calendar year. * The report can be accessed in electronic format. * The report can be given after the necessary checks for authentication of the individual is done like UID, PAN etc. Credit scoring reports are also available for non-individuals like companies etc.. 4.5 Responsible Borrowing Every individual has a need for some sort of debt or borrowings for meeting their various financial needs. Since there are several assets that are big ticket purchases, there is a need to have some debt to finance their purchases. Similarly, the use of electronic and plastic payment methods ensure that the individual is able to incur some expenses and pay them off in a few days. All these are facilities for an individual but they need to be used responsibly. One of the key points that every individual needs to follow is that they should never borrow more than what they can afford. A lifestyle that is flashy might seem enchanting but there is a cost that has to be paid for this and if this is not sustainable then it is better to not go down that path. In terms of expenses an individual should be responsible enough to buy only those things for which they can make payments. The best way to use a credit card is to pay off the amounts by the due date and not leave any amount as revolving credit. On the loan front it is better to borrow for assets that are value appreciating in nature and which can yield some income down the line. Also, too many loans at the same time can make debt servicing very difficult and hence this has to be avoided. Ensuring that debt options are 72 used responsibly will ensure that this is sustained over
